                 GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION METHOD
                </p>
                Gaussian elimination is a fundamental algorithm in linear 
                algebra used to solve systems of linear equations, find 
                matrix inverses, and determine matrix rank. Named after 
                Carl Friedrich Gauss, this method systematically transforms 
                a matrix into an upper triangular form, from which solutions 
                to the equations can be easily obtained. The process involves 
                three main steps: forward elimination, where the matrix is 
                reduced to upper triangular form; back substitution, 
                where the solutions are found by solving the equations 
                from the last row upwards; and pivoting, where rows are 
                swapped to improve numerical stability. Gaussian elimination 
                is not only efficient for small to moderately sized systems 
                but also forms the basis for more complex numerical methods 
                used in computational mathematics. The method is widely 
                applicable in engineering, physics, computer science, and 
                economics, where systems of linear equations frequently arise. 
                Despite its effectiveness, Gaussian elimination can be 
                computationally expensive for very large systems, making 
                alternative methods like LU decomposition or iterative 
                approaches more suitable in such cases. Nevertheless, 
                it remains a cornerstone of linear algebra, integral to 
                both theoretical studies and practical applications.
